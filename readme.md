## Document Introduction

### Creation Purposes

This document or readme file / repository was created with the sole intent to allow quick navigation through my various repositories that I wish to showcase for a
portfolio, as github doesn't really allow a means to create multiple repositories in one or downloading a specific folder (project) from a folder structure I
determined that the best way to go about this was to create a central readme file hub that would link to the various repositories across my profile and then pin this
to the top of my page.

### Information About The Projects

The projects contained withing are various small to larger scale projects that I have either worked on as
<br></br>
A // Part of a course or an assessment
<br></br>
B // An idea I have acquired or something personal I have decided to build
<br></br>
C // Group project or jam I have taken part in.
<br></br>

### Copywrite / Licensing

All code showcased in this portfolio (unless specified under the actual section below) will be subject to use under the GPLv3 free use license.

### Overall Section Layout

TO make the navigation easier I have created a table of contents for quick and easy movement, as well as this the projects will be broken down into three Sections

Section 1 - Misc Projects, these are all the projects / apps / scripts I have built that are designed to be small or standalone things and not really deserving of a 
huge section on the portfolio, clicking the link will take you to a seperate readme / repo with all of them included

Section 2 - Course projects, these are all projects I have built as part of a course with the aim of completing said course; with a twist, for each project I set to
learn something new be it big or small instead of doing follow alongs.

Section 3 - Solo / group apps. This is the main section of the portfolio, and where I will dedicate most of my time, it's where I am to create and build standalone programs and apps to 
showcase that I am job ready, They will be split between raw JS / React JS / Node JS and three JS.

## Project Showcase

### SECTION 1 - Misc project

This is a section dedicated to small sample projects or just quick do it in a day kind of projects i thought of making or was interested in giving a quick shot at. These are by no means porfolio worthy, but I like coding, it's cathartic and it's better to show all the work i do instead of just leave it hidden from everyone!

#### [Scientific Calculator](https://github.com/ShaAnder/calculator)

A fully functioning scientific calculator that the user can actively make calculations on.

### SECTION 2 - Course Projects 

These are projects and apps from the course work I have completed, while I have completed course on a myriad of topics including python php and HTML / CSS ect this is primarily contained
to my JavaScript course work and projects. 

As stated above I tried to add a twist to each project by learning something new and implementing it in the project to make it more my own and unique, or just to reinforce what I am learning,
the full details and information about this can be found in the small writeup i provide with each project. As i work more on these I shall be updating information / code, as while they are
initially course projects, they all have the potential for becoming real world applications and I would like to at least progress them to a dummy application stage!
